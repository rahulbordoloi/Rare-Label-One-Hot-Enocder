# Rare-Label-One-Hot Encoder

Rare-Label-One-Hot Encoder with Threshold Implementation and Python Package.

## About

It's a Categorical Encoder which can be mostly used with Classical Machine Learning Algorithms inorder to One-Hot-Encode a Feature having huge cardinality and also rare labels in the Train-Test set. <br>
Basically, it'll set a threshold (can be user-defined) of taking up the top categories/entries and treating the least significant as `others`. It also handles rare label cases in case of mapping the features from Train-Set to Test-Set and vice versa.
